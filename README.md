### !!Note to Reader!!
In this version uploaded I had been testing with a barcode scanning API and had slighly changed all of the styling. So some buttons and text seem slightly off

# What is it?

Fridge-Track is a web app designed for mobile that allows users to keep track of what they currently have in their fridge from their phone.
I often find myself at the grocery store wishing I had checked if I already had this at home before buying an ingredient, 
or if I just wanted to see what I have in my fridge from my couch without going over and staring into the fridge. 

I've also tried using other 'meal tracker' apps that allow you to track whats in your fridge but I find them very over cluttered. 
My web app has been designed entirely with the user in mind, keeping the interface clear while allowing intuitive precise control. 

## Technicals

The app uses Google Firestore's NoSQL database
